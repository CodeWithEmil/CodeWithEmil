Hello there and welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emilio NÃ¡jera, and I'm a frontend web developer and passionate programming content-creator. I'm originally from Mexico City (Mexico), and I really do love tacos!

I'm leader and founder of the "CodeWithEmil" project, an Instagram account that produces and publishes high-quality programming content, specifically designed to educate, inspire and help others grow in their coding journey
