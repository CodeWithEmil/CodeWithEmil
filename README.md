👋 Hey! I’m Emil (CodeWithEmil)
   Here are some things you should know about me:
<li> · 13 y/o</li>
 · Full Stack Web Developer
 · I'm an Instagram-based content creator, focused on Web Development
 · I’m interested in coding, learning languages, and playing the guitar!
<!--- 🌱 I’m currently learning VueJS, but I love to work with React
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on every project you give me the opportunity to :D
- 📫 Find me on social media as CodeWithEmil.-->

I haven't really added any of my projects here, but will begin to add them really soon (most of them were made when I knew nothing about Git, so there's no commits...).

I really hope we can hang out well. Thanks for reading! 🚀 🌎
